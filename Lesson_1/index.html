    Machu Picchu is the ruins of a small city built in the 1400s by the Inca Indians. It is found high in the Andes
    mountain range in central Peru, South America. Machu Picchu is 6,750 feet above sea level, set in a tropical forest
    between two mountains. The Urubamba River can be seen 3,000 feet below.

    The city likely served as a country estate for Inca nobles and as a religious retreat. It covered about 5 square
    miles and had 200 buildings. These included a palace, temples, storage buildings, and many smaller houses for
    servants. Fine craftsmen used local stone to build these structures, all of which were designed to fit into the
    landscape.

    Terraced gardens with irrigation channels were built on the city’s steep slopes to grow potatoes and corn for the
    community. Stone stairways connected the different levels. Only nobles and priests , and their servants, would have
    known about Machu Picchu. By 1527, half of the Inca population had died of smallpox. In the next few years, many
    more people were killed in civil wars between rival groups. When the Spanish conquered Peru in 1532, the city was
    probably already abandoned and forgotten.

    The Incas had no written language and the Spanish never discovered Machu Picchu, so the city remained forgotten
    until 1911. That year, an American historian and his local guides happened upon the ruined city. A few years later,
    an article appeared in the National Geographic Society’s magazine. Archeologists and tourists have been visiting it
    ever since.

    <p>In 1983, the United Nations named Machu Picchu a World Heritage Site. Today, it is Peru’s largest tourist
        attraction
        and is visited by 500,000 people each year. Some experts are concerned about the damage that so many visitors
        may be
        doing to the site.</p>

    Machu Picchu is also often called the "city in heaven" or "the city among the clouds", sometimes it is called the
    "lost city of the Incas". Some archaeologists believe that this city was created as a sacred mountain shelter by the
    great Inca ruler Pachacutec a century before the conquest of his empire, that is, around 1440, and functioned until
    1532, when the Spaniards invaded the territory of the Inca Empire. Similar to Machu Picchu, the high-altitude town
    of Choquiqurao lasted much longer, until the 1570s.</p>
<p>In 2007, it was awarded the title of the <strong>New World Wonder</strong>.</p>

    <h3>3 EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVES TO MACHU PICCHU</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <i>Kuélap</i>
            <p>Sitting high in the hills of Northern Peru, the mysterious ruins of Kuélap were once inhabited by the
                “people of the clouds”. The three levels of Kue´lap were built between 400BC – 1470AD, and are entirely
                unusual thanks to their round structure. In the excavation of the site, archaeologists discovered blonde
                mummies – no one really knows whether the cloud people were indigenous, Spanish, or Vikings.</p>
        </li>
        <li> <i>The Sacred Valley</i>
            <p>Within the Sacred Valley, you’ll find a host of other ruins like Ollantaytambo, Sacsayhuaman, and Pisac.
                While these ruins are slightly smaller and more spread out than Machu Picchu, you’ll have your fill of Incan
                ruins if combine several of them together. Grab a Boleto Turístico, and you can visit as many as 16 Incan
                ruins within the 10 days of validi.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> <i>Choquequirao</i>
            <p>Accessible only by a very difficult trek, Choquequirao is a partially-excavated complex of Incan ruins
                estimated to be about 3x the size of Machu Picchu. Choquequirao only draws about 20 visitors per day,
                ensuring the ruins are undamaged and quiet all the time. If there is any true alternative to Machu Picchu,
